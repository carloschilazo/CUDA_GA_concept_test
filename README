Conceptual program, evaluated some efficiency in terms of CUDA Blocksize and number of threads


//Test notes:

Only allocating one block of threads results in small population size

Need to handle multiple blocks

Maximum size of block is 512 threads (more on other CUDA devices, but lets keep it safe)

Population size must be really big, i must try to fill as much memory as possible on the device
